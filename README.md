# Nitrogen

> Shopify apps on Firebase. Inert by design — no framework, no server, no bill until you have real traffic.

## What is this?

The **Firebase alternative** to `shopify app init`. Instead of Remix + Prisma + Vercel, you get:

- **Firebase v2 Cloud Functions** (gen 2, Node 22) — 4 independent, auto-scaling functions
- **Cloud Firestore** for sessions and app data (auto-scaling, free tier)
- **Firebase Hosting** for your embedded admin dashboard (free)
- **Polaris web components + App Bridge** — 4 pages, no React, no build step
- **Theme App Extension** for storefront UI (works on all Shopify plans)
- **Shopify API 2026-07** — OAuth, session tokens, webhooks, GDPR handlers
- **Production-ready** — deployed and installable when the command finishes

One command does the whole thing: signs you in to Shopify, creates the app, creates
and provisions the Firebase project, deploys it, and hands you an install link.
No copying Client IDs between dashboards, and no pasting your Client Secret — the
CLI reads it from the Shopify CLI itself.

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

The CLI checks all of these before it does anything, and offers to install what's missing.

| Tool | Install | Required? |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Node.js 20+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) | Yes — Cloud Functions run on Node 22 |
| Firebase CLI | `npm i -g firebase-tools` | Yes — offered automatically if missing |
| Shopify CLI | `npm i -g @shopify/cli` | Yes — offered automatically if missing |
| git | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) | Optional — only for the initial commit |
| gcloud | [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) | Optional — auto-enables the Firestore API |

You also need a **Shopify Partner account** and a **Google account**. The CLI signs
you in to both; you don't need to open either dashboard first.

> **Cloud Functions require the Firebase Blaze plan.** It has a generous free tier
> (2M invocations/month), but a billing account must be attached. That is the one
> step the CLI cannot do silently for you.

### 1. Run the scaffold

```bash
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app
```

The CLI walks the entire flow. This is a real run:

```
  🛍️  +  🔥  Nitrogen

  === Environment Check ===

  ✔ Node.js        v22.20.0
  ✔ npm            10.9.4
  ✔ git            2.47.1
  ✔ Firebase CLI   15.10.0
  ✔ Shopify CLI    4.6.0
  ✔ gcloud         565.0.0
  ✔ Environment ready

  === Sign In to Shopify ===

  ℹ A browser window opens — approve the code shown below.
  ✔ Signed in to Shopify

  === Choose Your Template ===

  ? What would you like to create?
    ❯ Shopify + Firebase app (full-stack serverless)
      Extension-only app (Shopify CLI)

  === Project Setup ===

  ? Language for Cloud Functions        › TypeScript
  ? App name (shown in Shopify admin)   › My Store App
  ? What API access does your app need? › read_products

  === Scaffolding ===

  ✔ Created 33 files in my-store-app/

  === Create Your Shopify App ===

    (the Shopify CLI asks which organization, and lets you create a new app)
  ✔ Client ID:     12dfc4d0d6d0b40d85b0f64b80de28af
  ✔ Client Secret: shpss_09**************(38 chars)

  === Firebase Setup ===

  ? Which Google account should own this project? › you@gmail.com
  ? Select a Firebase project
    ❯ [create a new project]
      My Project (my-project-123)
      [add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud project]
      [enter project ID manually]

  ✔ Firestore: us-central1
  ✔ Web App: My Store App
  ✔ Hosting: https://my-store-app.web.app
  ✔ Artifact cleanup policy set — 'firebase deploy' will not prompt
  ✔ App config written — https://my-store-app.web.app

  === Installing & Building ===

  ✔ Dependencies installed
  ✔ TypeScript compiled successfully

  === Going Live ===

  ✔ Deployed to Firebase
  ✔ Shopify app updated

  ✔  All done! Your Shopify + Firebase app is ready.

  Your app is live. Install it on a dev store:

    https://my-store-app.web.app/auth?shop=YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com
```

**You never paste the Client Secret.** The CLI reads it from `shopify app env show`
once the app exists — which is exactly why the Shopify app is created *before* Firebase.

### 2. Install it on a development store

The command prints an install link when it finishes. Open it in a browser with your
store's domain substituted in:

```
https://YOUR-PROJECT.web.app/auth?shop=YOUR-STORE.myshopify.com
```

Approve the scopes and the app opens embedded in the Shopify admin.

### 3. Make changes

```bash
cd my-store-app
# edit web/ or functions/src/
firebase deploy --force
```

Or develop against a Shopify tunnel with hot reload:

```bash
shopify app dev
```

---

## Why Firebase?

**$0/month to run your Shopify app. No credit card cost. No server. No bill until you're big.**

Most Shopify app developers pay for hosting before they even have users. With Firebase, you deploy for free and only start paying when your app serves thousands of stores daily. Even at 50,000 installed stores, you're looking at ~$5/month. Try getting that from Vercel or Heroku.

| | `shopify app init` (Remix) | **Nitrogen** |
|---|---|---|
| **Backend** | Remix server (monolith) | Firebase v2 Cloud Functions (4 independent functions) |
| **Database** | Prisma + PostgreSQL | Cloud Firestore (NoSQL, auto-scaling) |
| **Frontend** | React + Polaris | Polaris web components + App Bridge (no build) |
| **Hosting** | Vercel / Fly.io / Heroku | Firebase Hosting (free tier) |
| **Auth** | `@shopify/shopify-app-react-router` | Manual OAuth (~150 lines, you own it) |
| **Build** | Webpack / Vite | `tsc` (TypeScript compiler, no bundler) |
| **Deploy** | Varies | Done for you — the CLI deploys before it exits |
| **Cost** | $5-25/month from day one | **$0/month** — free until you scale |
| **Framework knowledge** | Remix + React required | Express + HTML (that's it) |
| **Scaling** | Single server | Per-function auto-scaling (Cloud Run) |
| **GDPR webhooks** | Auto-handled | Included (ready for App Store) |
| **Theme extensions** | Supported | Supported (same Shopify format) |
| **Shopify Functions** | Supported | Supported (add via Shopify CLI) |

### When to use this

- You want to **launch for free** and only pay when your app takes off
- Custom apps for a single merchant
- Public apps with simple admin UIs
- Teams already using Firebase / Google Cloud
- You want to understand every line of your app

### When to use Remix instead

- Complex multi-page admin UIs with Polaris React components
- Large team already invested in the Remix ecosystem
- You need server-side rendering for your app pages

## Architecture

Each function scales independently on Cloud Run (Firebase v2 / gen 2):

```
  Shopify Admin (iframe)
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  Firebase Hosting (HTML/JS)         │
  │  + App Bridge (session tokens)      │
  └──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                 │ Bearer <JWT>
                 ▼
  Firebase v2 Cloud Functions (independent scaling)
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  auth()      → OAuth 2.0 flow      │  (standalone, no Express)
  │  api()       → Admin API (JWT)      │  (Express + middleware)
  │  webhooks()  → Webhooks (HMAC)      │  (standalone, no Express)
  │  proxy()     → App Proxy (HMAC)     │  (Express)
  └──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
  Cloud Firestore
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  shopSessions  → OAuth tokens       │
  │  authNonces    → CSRF protection    │
  │  (your data)   → App-specific       │
  └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Why split functions?

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| **Faster webhooks** | `webhooks()` has no Express overhead — responds in milliseconds |
| **Independent scaling** | Each function auto-scales based on its own traffic |
| **Targeted deploys** | `firebase deploy --only functions:api` deploys just one function |
| **Separate configs** | Each function gets its own memory, timeout, and concurrency |
| **Lower cold starts** | Smaller functions = faster cold starts |

### Three Security Layers

| Layer | Protects | How |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **OAuth 2.0** | App install | HMAC-verified code exchange → Firestore |
| **Session Token** | Admin API | App Bridge JWT (HS256) verified on every request |
| **HMAC Signature** | Proxy + Webhooks | SHA-256 timing-safe comparison |

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Interactive (recommended)
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen

# With project name
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app

# Skip the deploy steps (scaffold only)
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app --no-deploy

# Auto-install any missing CLI tools without asking
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app --yes

# Non-interactive (CI/CD)
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app \
  --api-key=abc123 \
  --api-secret=secret \
  --project-id=my-firebase-project \
  --create-project \
  --scopes=read_products,write_products

# Help
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen --help
```

## Migrating from create-shopify-firebase-app

Nitrogen was published as `create-shopify-firebase-app` up to 2.2.2. Only the
command changed — **nothing inside a generated project is affected**, and there
is no migration to run in apps you already scaffolded.

```bash
# before
npx create-shopify-firebase-app my-app

# now
npx @mksd0398/nitrogen my-app
```

The old package name is still published as a forwarding shim, so existing
scripts and CI jobs keep working — they print a notice and hand off to
Nitrogen unchanged. The shim is frozen at 3.0.0 and will not track future
releases, so switch when convenient.

If you installed the old package globally, replace it:

```bash
npm uninstall -g create-shopify-firebase-app
npm install -g @mksd0398/nitrogen
```

### Why the rename

The old name described the stack instead of naming the tool, ran to 28
characters, and put "shopify" inside a third-party package name. Nitrogen
follows the element naming of Shopify's own developer products — Hydrogen,
Oxygen — and reads as the inert 78% of the atmosphere that everything else
runs inside, which is what a zero-framework scaffolder is.

It ships scoped because the bare `nitrogen` name on npm belongs to an
unrelated, actively maintained project. Scoping also matches how Shopify
publishes its own packages: `@shopify/polaris`, `@shopify/app-bridge`.

## Development

### Local with Firebase Emulators

```bash
cd functions
npm run serve
# Functions → http://localhost:5001
# Firestore → http://localhost:8080
```

### Local with Shopify CLI

```bash
shopify app dev
# Creates tunnel + hot reload
```

### Deploy

```bash
firebase deploy                        # Everything
firebase deploy --only functions       # All functions
firebase deploy --only functions:auth  # Just auth function
firebase deploy --only functions:api   # Just API function
firebase deploy --only hosting         # Frontend only
```

---

## Extending Your App

### Add a new Cloud Function

This is the most common extension pattern. Create a new file, export a handler, and wire it up:

**1. Create `functions/src/my-feature.ts`:**

```typescript
import type { Request, Response } from "firebase-functions/v2/https";
import { db } from "./firebase";

export async function myFeatureHandler(req: Request, res: Response) {
  // Your logic here
  res.json({ success: true });
}
```

**2. Export it in `functions/src/index.ts`:**

```typescript
import { myFeatureHandler } from "./my-feature";

export const myFeature = onRequest(
  { memory: "256MiB", timeoutSeconds: 60 },
  myFeatureHandler,
);
```

**3. Add a rewrite in `firebase.json`:**

```json
{ "source": "/my-feature/**", "function": "myFeature" }
```

**4. Deploy just your function:**

```bash
firebase deploy --only functions:myFeature
```

### Add admin API routes

Edit `functions/src/admin-api.ts`:

```typescript
adminApiRouter.post("/my-endpoint", async (req, res) => {
  const shop = (req as any).shopDomain;
  const token = await getAccessToken(shop);
  // Call Shopify Admin API, write to Firestore, etc.
  res.json({ success: true });
});
```

### Add storefront routes (App Proxy)

Edit `functions/src/proxy.ts` and enable `[app_proxy]` in `shopify.app.toml`:

```typescript
proxyRouter.get("/my-route", (req, res) => {
  if (!verifyProxySignature(req.query)) return res.status(403).json({ error: "Invalid" });
  res.json({ hello: "storefront" });
});
```

### Add webhook handlers

Edit `functions/src/webhooks.ts` and register in `shopify.app.toml`:

```typescript
case "orders/create": {
  const order = body;
  // Your logic
  break;
}
```

### Add Firestore collections

```typescript
import { db } from "./firebase";
await db.collection("myData").doc("id").set({ key: "value" });
```

### Add frontend pages

Create `web/settings.html`, use the same pattern, navigate with `App.navigate("/settings.html")`.

### Add Shopify billing

Use the `appSubscriptionCreate` GraphQL mutation in your admin API routes.

### Add a scheduled function (cron)

```typescript
// functions/src/cleanup.ts
import { onSchedule } from "firebase-functions/v2/scheduler";
import { db } from "./firebase";

export const dailyCleanup = onSchedule("every 24 hours", async () => {
  // Clean up expired nonces, old data, etc.
  const cutoff = new Date(Date.now() - 48 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
  const old = await db.collection("authNonces")
    .where("createdAt", "<", cutoff.toISOString()).get();
  for (const doc of old.docs) await doc.ref.delete();
});
```

Export it in `index.ts`:
```typescript
export { dailyCleanup } from "./cleanup";
```

## How Many Stores Can You Run for Free?

Firebase's free tier is generous. Here's what it actually means for a Shopify app:

### What each store costs you per day

Every time a merchant opens your app or a webhook fires, it uses a small amount of Firebase resources:

| What happens | Function calls | DB reads | DB writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Merchant opens your app in Shopify admin | 5 | 5 | 0 |
| Webhooks fire (orders, inventory updates) | 5 | 5 | 2 |
| **Total per store per day** | **~10** | **~10** | **~2** |

### How many stores you can run for $0/month

Firebase gives you a free quota every day. Divide that by per-store usage:

| Firebase resource | Free daily quota | Enough for |
|---|---|---|
| Cloud Functions | 66,000 calls/day | **~6,600 stores** |
| Firestore reads | 50,000 reads/day | **~5,000 stores** |
| Firestore writes | 20,000 writes/day | **~10,000 stores** |
| Hosting (HTML/CSS/JS) | 360 MB/day | **~7,000 stores** (cached after first load) |

**You hit the free limit at ~5,000 daily active stores.** Firestore reads is the first resource to run out.

Not every installed merchant opens your app daily. With a typical 20% daily active rate:

> **Free tier supports ~25,000 installed stores** with normal usage patterns. That's $0/month.

### When you outgrow free (Blaze pay-as-you-go)

| Installed Stores | Daily Active | Monthly Cost |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 - 25,000 | up to 5,000 | **$0 (free)** |
| 50,000 | ~10,000 | **~$5/month** |
| 100,000 | ~20,000 | **~$15/month** |
| 500,000 | ~100,000 | **~$80/month** |

Compare that to Vercel/Heroku at **$25-100/month from day one**, before you even have your first user.

No credit card required to start. No server to manage. No bill until you're successful.

---

## GDPR Compliance

All three mandatory GDPR webhooks are included and handled:

| Webhook | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `customers/data_request` | Export customer data | Handler included (add your logic) |
| `customers/redact` | Delete customer data | Handler included (add your logic) |
| `shop/redact` | Delete all shop data | Handler included (add your logic) |

These are **required** for Shopify App Store listing.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "Missing shop parameter" | Set **App URL** in Partner Dashboard to `https://PROJECT_ID.web.app` |
| "HMAC verification failed" | Check `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` in `functions/.env` |
| "Invalid session token" | Check `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` in `functions/.env` — the JWT is signed with it |
| Functions not receiving requests | Check `firebase.json` rewrites match function export names in `index.ts` |
| Webhook failures | Must respond 200 within 5 seconds. Check `firebase functions:log` |
| `firebase deploy` exits 1 on a new project | Use `firebase deploy --force` — a bare deploy stalls on the artifact-policy prompt and leaves Hosting unreleased |
| Firestore create fails with 403 | The Firestore API is not enabled yet: `gcloud services enable firestore.googleapis.com --project=YOUR_ID` |
| `App name cannot contain "Shopify"` | Shopify rejects those names — pick another (the CLI now strips it automatically) |
| `shopify app deploy` says "not a member of the organization" | The app was created under a different Shopify account. Run `shopify auth login` |
| Individual function not deploying | Ensure export name in `index.ts` matches function name in `firebase.json` rewrite |
